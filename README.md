## About
About information here..

## Installation

You may need to permit installations from unknown sources. To do this, navigate to your device's settings:

```
Settings > Security (or Settings > Apps > Security)
```

and activate the "<b><i>Unknown Sources</i></b>" option.


1. **Download:**
   - Download and Extract the latest release to your desired path.

2. **Install the APK:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

     ```batch
     :: Install the APK file
     adb install -r "path/PhoneDo.apk"
     ```

3. **Restore Sampled Demo Scripts (<b><i>Optional</i></b>)**

    - To make the sampled scripts available for experimenting with, run the following command to restore a prepared adb backup file:
        ```batch
        adb restore "path/PhoneDoExamples.ab"
        ```
4. **Allow All App Permissions (<b><i>Optional</i></b>)**

   If you want an uninterrupted experience, you can pregrant all of the wanted permissions, even though a script can  request any of them at runtime.

   - At your device's Settings,
     navigate to "Apps" or "Application Manager," depending on your device.
     
   - Find and select <b><i>PhoneDo</i></b> from the list of installed apps.
   - Look for the <b><i>Permissions</i></b> or <b><i>App Permissions</i></b> section.
   - Enable or grant all the permissions listed under PhoneDo.
